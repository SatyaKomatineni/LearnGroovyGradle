 * To exercise basic gradle build

 * See what configurations are out of the box with a plain gradle build
 *
 * The configuration avaialble are different and distinct
 * in the buildscript and outside buildscript.
 * In buildscript: class
 * In rest of the script: none
 *
 * A configuration represents a set of files.
